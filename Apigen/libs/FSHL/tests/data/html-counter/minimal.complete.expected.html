<span class="line">  2: </span>                       Version 3, 29 June 2007
<span class="line">  3: </span>
<span class="line">  4: </span> Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
<span class="line">  5: </span> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
<span class="line">  6: </span> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
<span class="line">  7: </span>
<span class="line">  8: </span>                            Preamble
<span class="line">  9: </span>
<span class="line"> 10: </span>  The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
<span class="line"> 11: </span>software and other kinds of works.
<span class="line"> 12: </span>
<span class="line"> 13: </span>  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
<span class="line"> 14: </span>to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
<span class="line"> 15: </span>the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
<span class="line"> 16: </span>share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
<span class="line"> 17: </span>software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
<span class="line"> 18: </span>GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to
<span class="line"> 19: </span>any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
<span class="line"> 20: </span>your programs, too.
<span class="line"> 21: </span>
<span class="line"> 22: </span>  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
<span class="line"> 23: </span>price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
<span class="line"> 24: </span>have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
<span class="line"> 25: </span>them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
<span class="line"> 26: </span>want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
<span class="line"> 27: </span>free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
<span class="line"> 28: </span>
<span class="line"> 29: </span>  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
<span class="line"> 30: </span>these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
<span class="line"> 31: </span>certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if
<span class="line"> 32: </span>you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
<span class="line"> 33: </span>
<span class="line"> 34: </span>  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
<span class="line"> 35: </span>gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
<span class="line"> 36: </span>freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
<span class="line"> 37: </span>or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
<span class="line"> 38: </span>know their rights.
<span class="line"> 39: </span>
<span class="line"> 40: </span>  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
<span class="line"> 41: </span>(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
<span class="line"> 42: </span>giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
<span class="line"> 43: </span>
<span class="line"> 44: </span>  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
<span class="line"> 45: </span>that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and
<span class="line"> 46: </span>authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
<span class="line"> 47: </span>changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
<span class="line"> 48: </span>authors of previous versions.
<span class="line"> 49: </span>
<span class="line"> 50: </span>  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
<span class="line"> 51: </span>modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
<span class="line"> 52: </span>can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
<span class="line"> 53: </span>protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
<span class="line"> 54: </span>pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to
<span class="line"> 55: </span>use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
<span class="line"> 56: </span>have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those
<span class="line"> 57: </span>products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
<span class="line"> 58: </span>stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
<span class="line"> 59: </span>of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
<span class="line"> 60: </span>
<span class="line"> 61: </span>  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
<span class="line"> 62: </span>States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
<span class="line"> 63: </span>software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
<span class="line"> 64: </span>avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
<span class="line"> 65: </span>make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
<span class="line"> 66: </span>patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
<span class="line"> 67: </span>
<span class="line"> 68: </span>  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
<span class="line"> 69: </span>modification follow.
<span class="line"> 70: </span>
<span class="line"> 71: </span>                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<span class="line"> 72: </span>
<span class="line"> 73: </span>  0. Definitions.
<span class="line"> 74: </span>
<span class="line"> 75: </span>  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
<span class="line"> 76: </span>
<span class="line"> 77: </span>  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
<span class="line"> 78: </span>works, such as semiconductor masks.
<span class="line"> 79: </span>
<span class="line"> 80: </span>  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
<span class="line"> 81: </span>License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
<span class="line"> 82: </span>&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
<span class="line"> 83: </span>
<span class="line"> 84: </span>  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
<span class="line"> 85: </span>in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
<span class="line"> 86: </span>exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
<span class="line"> 87: </span>earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
<span class="line"> 88: </span>
<span class="line"> 89: </span>  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
<span class="line"> 90: </span>on the Program.
<span class="line"> 91: </span>
<span class="line"> 92: </span>  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
<span class="line"> 93: </span>permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
<span class="line"> 94: </span>infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
<span class="line"> 95: </span>computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
<span class="line"> 96: </span>distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
<span class="line"> 97: </span>public, and in some countries other activities as well.
<span class="line"> 98: </span>
<span class="line"> 99: </span>  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
<span class="line">100: </span>parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
<span class="line">101: </span>a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
<span class="line">102: </span>
<span class="line">103: </span>  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
<span class="line">104: </span>to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
<span class="line">105: </span>feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
<span class="line">106: </span>tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
<span class="line">107: </span>extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
<span class="line">108: </span>work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
<span class="line">109: </span>the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
<span class="line">110: </span>menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
<span class="line">111: </span>
<span class="line">112: </span>  1. Source Code.
<span class="line">113: </span>
<span class="line">114: </span>  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work
<span class="line">115: </span>for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
<span class="line">116: </span>form of a work.
<span class="line">117: </span>
<span class="line">118: </span>  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
<span class="line">119: </span>standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
<span class="line">120: </span>interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
<span class="line">121: </span>is widely used among developers working in that language.
<span class="line">122: </span>
<span class="line">123: </span>  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
<span class="line">124: </span>than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
<span class="line">125: </span>packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
<span class="line">126: </span>Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
<span class="line">127: </span>Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
<span class="line">128: </span>implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
<span class="line">129: </span>&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
<span class="line">130: </span>(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
<span class="line">131: </span>(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
<span class="line">132: </span>produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
<span class="line">133: </span>
<span class="line">134: </span>  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all
<span class="line">135: </span>the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
<span class="line">136: </span>work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
<span class="line">137: </span>control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
<span class="line">138: </span>System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
<span class="line">139: </span>programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
<span class="line">140: </span>which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
<span class="line">141: </span>includes interface definition files associated with source files for
<span class="line">142: </span>the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
<span class="line">143: </span>linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
<span class="line">144: </span>such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
<span class="line">145: </span>subprograms and other parts of the work.
<span class="line">146: </span>
<span class="line">147: </span>  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
<span class="line">148: </span>can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
<span class="line">149: </span>Source.
<span class="line">150: </span>
<span class="line">151: </span>  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
<span class="line">152: </span>same work.
<span class="line">153: </span>
<span class="line">154: </span>  2. Basic Permissions.
<span class="line">155: </span>
<span class="line">156: </span>  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
<span class="line">157: </span>copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
<span class="line">158: </span>conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
<span class="line">159: </span>permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
<span class="line">160: </span>covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
<span class="line">161: </span>content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
<span class="line">162: </span>rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
<span class="line">163: </span>
<span class="line">164: </span>  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
<span class="line">165: </span>convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
<span class="line">166: </span>in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
<span class="line">167: </span>of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
<span class="line">168: </span>with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
<span class="line">169: </span>the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
<span class="line">170: </span>not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
<span class="line">171: </span>for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
<span class="line">172: </span>and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
<span class="line">173: </span>your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
<span class="line">174: </span>
<span class="line">175: </span>  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
<span class="line">176: </span>the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
<span class="line">177: </span>makes it unnecessary.
<span class="line">178: </span>
<span class="line">179: </span>  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
<span class="line">180: </span>
<span class="line">181: </span>  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
<span class="line">182: </span>measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
<span class="line">183: </span>11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
<span class="line">184: </span>similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
<span class="line">185: </span>measures.
<span class="line">186: </span>
<span class="line">187: </span>  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
<span class="line">188: </span>circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
<span class="line">189: </span>is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
<span class="line">190: </span>the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
<span class="line">191: </span>modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
<span class="line">192: </span>users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
<span class="line">193: </span>technological measures.
<span class="line">194: </span>
<span class="line">195: </span>  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
<span class="line">196: </span>
<span class="line">197: </span>  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
<span class="line">198: </span>receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
<span class="line">199: </span>appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
<span class="line">200: </span>keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
<span class="line">201: </span>non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
<span class="line">202: </span>keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
<span class="line">203: </span>recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
<span class="line">204: </span>
<span class="line">205: </span>  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
<span class="line">206: </span>and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.
<span class="line">207: </span>
<span class="line">208: </span>  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
<span class="line">209: </span>
<span class="line">210: </span>  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
<span class="line">211: </span>produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
<span class="line">212: </span>terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<span class="line">213: </span>
<span class="line">214: </span>    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
<span class="line">215: </span>    it, and giving a relevant date.
<span class="line">216: </span>
<span class="line">217: </span>    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
<span class="line">218: </span>    released under this License and any conditions added under section
<span class="line">219: </span>    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
<span class="line">220: </span>    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
<span class="line">221: </span>
<span class="line">222: </span>    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
<span class="line">223: </span>    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
<span class="line">224: </span>    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
<span class="line">225: </span>    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
<span class="line">226: </span>    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
<span class="line">227: </span>    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
<span class="line">228: </span>    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
<span class="line">229: </span>
<span class="line">230: </span>    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
<span class="line">231: </span>    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
<span class="line">232: </span>    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
<span class="line">233: </span>    work need not make them do so.
<span class="line">234: </span>
<span class="line">235: </span>  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
<span class="line">236: </span>works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
<span class="line">237: </span>and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
<span class="line">238: </span>in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
<span class="line">239: </span>&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
<span class="line">240: </span>used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
<span class="line">241: </span>beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
<span class="line">242: </span>in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
<span class="line">243: </span>parts of the aggregate.
<span class="line">244: </span>
<span class="line">245: </span>  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
<span class="line">246: </span>
<span class="line">247: </span>  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
<span class="line">248: </span>of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
<span class="line">249: </span>machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
<span class="line">250: </span>in one of these ways:
<span class="line">251: </span>
<span class="line">252: </span>    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<span class="line">253: </span>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
<span class="line">254: </span>    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
<span class="line">255: </span>    customarily used for software interchange.
<span class="line">256: </span>
<span class="line">257: </span>    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
<span class="line">258: </span>    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
<span class="line">259: </span>    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
<span class="line">260: </span>    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
<span class="line">261: </span>    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
<span class="line">262: </span>    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
<span class="line">263: </span>    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
<span class="line">264: </span>    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
<span class="line">265: </span>    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
<span class="line">266: </span>    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
<span class="line">267: </span>    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
<span class="line">268: </span>
<span class="line">269: </span>    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
<span class="line">270: </span>    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
<span class="line">271: </span>    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
<span class="line">272: </span>    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
<span class="line">273: </span>    with subsection 6b.
<span class="line">274: </span>
<span class="line">275: </span>    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
<span class="line">276: </span>    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
<span class="line">277: </span>    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
<span class="line">278: </span>    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
<span class="line">279: </span>    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
<span class="line">280: </span>    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
<span class="line">281: </span>    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
<span class="line">282: </span>    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
<span class="line">283: </span>    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
<span class="line">284: </span>    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
<span class="line">285: </span>    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
<span class="line">286: </span>    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
<span class="line">287: </span>
<span class="line">288: </span>    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
<span class="line">289: </span>    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
<span class="line">290: </span>    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
<span class="line">291: </span>    charge under subsection 6d.
<span class="line">292: </span>
<span class="line">293: </span>  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
<span class="line">294: </span>from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
<span class="line">295: </span>included in conveying the object code work.
<span class="line">296: </span>
<span class="line">297: </span>  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
<span class="line">298: </span>tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
<span class="line">299: </span>or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
<span class="line">300: </span>into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
<span class="line">301: </span>doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
<span class="line">302: </span>product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
<span class="line">303: </span>typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
<span class="line">304: </span>of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
<span class="line">305: </span>actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
<span class="line">306: </span>is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
<span class="line">307: </span>commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
<span class="line">308: </span>the only significant mode of use of the product.
<span class="line">309: </span>
<span class="line">310: </span>  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,
<span class="line">311: </span>procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
<span class="line">312: </span>and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
<span class="line">313: </span>a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
<span class="line">314: </span>suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
<span class="line">315: </span>code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
<span class="line">316: </span>modification has been made.
<span class="line">317: </span>
<span class="line">318: </span>  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
<span class="line">319: </span>specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
<span class="line">320: </span>part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
<span class="line">321: </span>User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
<span class="line">322: </span>fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
<span class="line">323: </span>Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
<span class="line">324: </span>by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
<span class="line">325: </span>if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
<span class="line">326: </span>modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
<span class="line">327: </span>been installed in ROM).
<span class="line">328: </span>
<span class="line">329: </span>  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
<span class="line">330: </span>requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
<span class="line">331: </span>for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
<span class="line">332: </span>the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
<span class="line">333: </span>network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
<span class="line">334: </span>adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
<span class="line">335: </span>protocols for communication across the network.
<span class="line">336: </span>
<span class="line">337: </span>  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
<span class="line">338: </span>in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
<span class="line">339: </span>documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
<span class="line">340: </span>source code form), and must require no special password or key for
<span class="line">341: </span>unpacking, reading or copying.
<span class="line">342: </span>
<span class="line">343: </span>  7. Additional Terms.
<span class="line">344: </span>
<span class="line">345: </span>  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
<span class="line">346: </span>License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
<span class="line">347: </span>Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
<span class="line">348: </span>be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
<span class="line">349: </span>that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
<span class="line">350: </span>apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
<span class="line">351: </span>under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
<span class="line">352: </span>this License without regard to the additional permissions.
<span class="line">353: </span>
<span class="line">354: </span>  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
<span class="line">355: </span>remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
<span class="line">356: </span>it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
<span class="line">357: </span>removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
<span class="line">358: </span>additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
<span class="line">359: </span>for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
<span class="line">360: </span>
<span class="line">361: </span>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
<span class="line">362: </span>add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
<span class="line">363: </span>that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
<span class="line">364: </span>
<span class="line">365: </span>    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
<span class="line">366: </span>    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
<span class="line">367: </span>
<span class="line">368: </span>    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
<span class="line">369: </span>    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
<span class="line">370: </span>    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
<span class="line">371: </span>
<span class="line">372: </span>    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
<span class="line">373: </span>    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
<span class="line">374: </span>    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
<span class="line">375: </span>
<span class="line">376: </span>    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
<span class="line">377: </span>    authors of the material; or
<span class="line">378: </span>
<span class="line">379: </span>    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
<span class="line">380: </span>    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
<span class="line">381: </span>
<span class="line">382: </span>    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
<span class="line">383: </span>    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
<span class="line">384: </span>    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
<span class="line">385: </span>    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
<span class="line">386: </span>    those licensors and authors.
<span class="line">387: </span>
<span class="line">388: </span>  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
<span class="line">389: </span>restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
<span class="line">390: </span>received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
<span class="line">391: </span>governed by this License along with a term that is a further
<span class="line">392: </span>restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
<span class="line">393: </span>a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
<span class="line">394: </span>License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
<span class="line">395: </span>of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
<span class="line">396: </span>not survive such relicensing or conveying.
<span class="line">397: </span>
<span class="line">398: </span>  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
<span class="line">399: </span>must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
<span class="line">400: </span>additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
<span class="line">401: </span>where to find the applicable terms.
<span class="line">402: </span>
<span class="line">403: </span>  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
<span class="line">404: </span>form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
<span class="line">405: </span>the above requirements apply either way.
<span class="line">406: </span>
<span class="line">407: </span>  8. Termination.
<span class="line">408: </span>
<span class="line">409: </span>  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
<span class="line">410: </span>provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
<span class="line">411: </span>modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
<span class="line">412: </span>this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
<span class="line">413: </span>paragraph of section 11).
<span class="line">414: </span>
<span class="line">415: </span>  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
<span class="line">416: </span>license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
<span class="line">417: </span>provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
<span class="line">418: </span>finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
<span class="line">419: </span>holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
<span class="line">420: </span>prior to 60 days after the cessation.
<span class="line">421: </span>
<span class="line">422: </span>  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
<span class="line">423: </span>reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
<span class="line">424: </span>violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
<span class="line">425: </span>received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
<span class="line">426: </span>copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
<span class="line">427: </span>your receipt of the notice.
<span class="line">428: </span>
<span class="line">429: </span>  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
<span class="line">430: </span>licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
<span class="line">431: </span>this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
<span class="line">432: </span>reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
<span class="line">433: </span>material under section 10.
<span class="line">434: </span>
<span class="line">435: </span>  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.
<span class="line">436: </span>
<span class="line">437: </span>  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
<span class="line">438: </span>run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
<span class="line">439: </span>occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
<span class="line">440: </span>to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
<span class="line">441: </span>nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
<span class="line">442: </span>modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
<span class="line">443: </span>not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
<span class="line">444: </span>covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
<span class="line">445: </span>
<span class="line">446: </span>  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
<span class="line">447: </span>
<span class="line">448: </span>  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
<span class="line">449: </span>receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
<span class="line">450: </span>propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
<span class="line">451: </span>for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
<span class="line">452: </span>
<span class="line">453: </span>  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
<span class="line">454: </span>organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
<span class="line">455: </span>organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
<span class="line">456: </span>work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
<span class="line">457: </span>transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
<span class="line">458: </span>licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
<span class="line">459: </span>give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
<span class="line">460: </span>Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
<span class="line">461: </span>the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
<span class="line">462: </span>
<span class="line">463: </span>  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
<span class="line">464: </span>rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
<span class="line">465: </span>not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
<span class="line">466: </span>rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
<span class="line">467: </span>(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
<span class="line">468: </span>any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
<span class="line">469: </span>sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
<span class="line">470: </span>
<span class="line">471: </span>  11. Patents.
<span class="line">472: </span>
<span class="line">473: </span>  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
<span class="line">474: </span>License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
<span class="line">475: </span>work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.
<span class="line">476: </span>
<span class="line">477: </span>  A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
<span class="line">478: </span>owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
<span class="line">479: </span>hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
<span class="line">480: </span>by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
<span class="line">481: </span>but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
<span class="line">482: </span>consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
<span class="line">483: </span>purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
<span class="line">484: </span>patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
<span class="line">485: </span>this License.
<span class="line">486: </span>
<span class="line">487: </span>  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
<span class="line">488: </span>patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
<span class="line">489: </span>make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
<span class="line">490: </span>propagate the contents of its contributor version.
<span class="line">491: </span>
<span class="line">492: </span>  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
<span class="line">493: </span>agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
<span class="line">494: </span>(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
<span class="line">495: </span>sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
<span class="line">496: </span>party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
<span class="line">497: </span>patent against the party.
<span class="line">498: </span>
<span class="line">499: </span>  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
<span class="line">500: </span>and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
<span class="line">501: </span>to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
<span class="line">502: </span>publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
<span class="line">503: </span>then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
<span class="line">504: </span>available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
<span class="line">505: </span>patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
<span class="line">506: </span>consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
<span class="line">507: </span>license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
<span class="line">508: </span>actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
<span class="line">509: </span>covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
<span class="line">510: </span>in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
<span class="line">511: </span>country that you have reason to believe are valid.
<span class="line">512: </span>
<span class="line">513: </span>  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
<span class="line">514: </span>arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
<span class="line">515: </span>covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
<span class="line">516: </span>receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
<span class="line">517: </span>or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
<span class="line">518: </span>you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
<span class="line">519: </span>work and works based on it.
<span class="line">520: </span>
<span class="line">521: </span>  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within
<span class="line">522: </span>the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
<span class="line">523: </span>conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
<span class="line">524: </span>specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
<span class="line">525: </span>work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
<span class="line">526: </span>in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
<span class="line">527: </span>to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
<span class="line">528: </span>the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
<span class="line">529: </span>parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
<span class="line">530: </span>patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
<span class="line">531: </span>conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
<span class="line">532: </span>for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
<span class="line">533: </span>contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
<span class="line">534: </span>or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
<span class="line">535: </span>
<span class="line">536: </span>  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
<span class="line">537: </span>any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
<span class="line">538: </span>otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.
<span class="line">539: </span>
<span class="line">540: </span>  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
<span class="line">541: </span>
<span class="line">542: </span>  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
<span class="line">543: </span>otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
<span class="line">544: </span>excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
<span class="line">545: </span>covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
<span class="line">546: </span>License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
<span class="line">547: </span>not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
<span class="line">548: </span>to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
<span class="line">549: </span>the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
<span class="line">550: </span>License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
<span class="line">551: </span>
<span class="line">552: </span>  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
<span class="line">553: </span>
<span class="line">554: </span>  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
<span class="line">555: </span>permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
<span class="line">556: </span>under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
<span class="line">557: </span>combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
<span class="line">558: </span>License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
<span class="line">559: </span>but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
<span class="line">560: </span>section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
<span class="line">561: </span>combination as such.
<span class="line">562: </span>
<span class="line">563: </span>  14. Revised Versions of this License.
<span class="line">564: </span>
<span class="line">565: </span>  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
<span class="line">566: </span>the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
<span class="line">567: </span>be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
<span class="line">568: </span>address new problems or concerns.
<span class="line">569: </span>
<span class="line">570: </span>  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
<span class="line">571: </span>Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
<span class="line">572: </span>Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
<span class="line">573: </span>option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
<span class="line">574: </span>version or of any later version published by the Free Software
<span class="line">575: </span>Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
<span class="line">576: </span>GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
<span class="line">577: </span>by the Free Software Foundation.
<span class="line">578: </span>
<span class="line">579: </span>  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
<span class="line">580: </span>versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
<span class="line">581: </span>public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
<span class="line">582: </span>to choose that version for the Program.
<span class="line">583: </span>
<span class="line">584: </span>  Later license versions may give you additional or different
<span class="line">585: </span>permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
<span class="line">586: </span>author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
<span class="line">587: </span>later version.
<span class="line">588: </span>
<span class="line">589: </span>  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
<span class="line">590: </span>
<span class="line">591: </span>  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
<span class="line">592: </span>APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
<span class="line">593: </span>HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
<span class="line">594: </span>OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
<span class="line">595: </span>THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
<span class="line">596: </span>PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
<span class="line">597: </span>IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
<span class="line">598: </span>ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<span class="line">599: </span>
<span class="line">600: </span>  16. Limitation of Liability.
<span class="line">601: </span>
<span class="line">602: </span>  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
<span class="line">603: </span>WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
<span class="line">604: </span>THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
<span class="line">605: </span>GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
<span class="line">606: </span>USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
<span class="line">607: </span>DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
<span class="line">608: </span>PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
<span class="line">609: </span>EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
<span class="line">610: </span>SUCH DAMAGES.
<span class="line">611: </span>
<span class="line">612: </span>  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
<span class="line">613: </span>
<span class="line">614: </span>  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
<span class="line">615: </span>above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
<span class="line">616: </span>reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
<span class="line">617: </span>an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
<span class="line">618: </span>Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
<span class="line">619: </span>copy of the Program in return for a fee.
<span class="line">620: </span>
<span class="line">621: </span>                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
<span class="line">622: </span>
<span class="line">623: </span>            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
<span class="line">624: </span>
<span class="line">625: </span>  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
<span class="line">626: </span>possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
<span class="line">627: </span>free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<span class="line">628: </span>
<span class="line">629: </span>  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
<span class="line">630: </span>to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
<span class="line">631: </span>state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
<span class="line">632: </span>the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<span class="line">633: </span>
<span class="line">634: </span>    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

<span class="line">651: </span>
<span class="line">652: </span>  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short
<span class="line">653: </span>notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:
